      Tags are mainly for easy grouping. Type them separated with comma. Some tags also have special functionallity:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label label-primary">hide</span> prevents task from appearing in task list. However, when you start filtering tasks, it will appear.</li>
        <li>
          <span class="label label-primary">complete</span> marks task completed. This tag is added when you click on
          <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">
            <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i>
          </button>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>All existing tags</dt>
    <dd>
      These are all tags you ever used:
      <br />
      <% @tags.each do |tag| %>
        <span class="label label-primary"><%= tag.name %></span>
      <% end %>
    </dd>
