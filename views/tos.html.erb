        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>
          SupTasks is app for personal task and time tracking. I build it primarily for my own purposes but i will be happy to have someone else using it too.
        </p>
        <p>
          However you have to note and accept few things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SupTasks might and will change often. Can happen without previous notice.</li>
          <li>SupTasks can end at any point in time without previous notice.</li>
          <li>SupTasks can have bugs which i try to fix ASAP but SupTasks can be in broken state for any period of time. Also without previous notice.</li>
          <li>Only personal data SupTasks needs to know is your email, tasks, time records and tags. I will never sell or give or whatever of these to any third party. But as everything is hackable today i can't and don't guarantee any privacy of these. I will try to do my best to secure it tho.</li>

          <li>If you don't accept these terms go away please. Using the app means you accept it.</li>
        </ul>
