## Contributing

I'v decided to release this project under MIT license so you are free to fork it and do whatever you want with it. However, here in this repo i will not accept any pull requests. This is my side project and right now i'm feeling like writing all the code myself. It's kind of a therapy for me.

 But i will be more than happy for your feedback in form of issues here.
